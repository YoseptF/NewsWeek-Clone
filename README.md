## Details  

### Bootstrap 
- Everything is aligned and spaced with bootstrap rows and columns, even the responsiveness comes from classes :D

### Themed boots

- I used Sass to theme my bootstrap a little bit, mostly to change some margin and padding sizes, but also to change the primary and secondary colors so that I don't need to type it evertime
-I didn't upload the sass files as they are not needed in the live version

## Built With

- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Sass
- VSCode

## Live Demo
